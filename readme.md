# Companies browser

The app serves the purpose of viewing company details (in particular - their financial attributes) which are available
 through external API. Presents a general overview of all companies as well as in-depth view of particular company.

To run the app simply open `index.html` in your browser.

## Technically 
The app is built with the help of:
- jQuery 3.3.1
- jQuery UI 1.12.1 (date picker)
- Bootstrap 4 (with bootstrap DataTable)
- MDB 4.14.1 (chart)

The app is NOT built as a single page application (I do not feel comfortable enough with React yet), therefore the
 app has been built using legacy technologies.
